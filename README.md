Design an SDN application that provides an API to other SDN applications that want to make use of the connected datapaths. This could be helpful in the scope of Take5 and national test beds where some orchestration of SDN apps would be required. The main idea is offer a sliced view of the datapaths to the remote/local applications. As a first step the app could offer a customized REST API that includes the scope of the transaction, i.e. Aalto, VTT, Nokia. The app needs to provide mechanisms so that different scopes do not overlap with each other. This can be done by mapping 1:1 flows and tables to the real datapath thus filtering out of scope request or by providing a jailed-view of the datapath with some translation between the tables x:y. Additionally, the provisioning of the Table-0 could be handled somewhat different as it constitutes the first table that is matched when a packet arrives and there could be contention for catching the flow. Initially it can be pre-provisioned to forward to the appropriate flow table of the “scope”.
